Usage tips :


1. All the relevant 3-point full body IK assets are put up in the "FullbodyIK" folder

2. This project is just the VRE sample project with the VR IK added on top of it. Any
VRE related problems and queries are best communicated with the VRE dev at discord.

3. This project has 3-point IK, leg animations based on HMD movement, crouching adjustment,
speed warping and height adjustment. This is the main reason it looks like there is a lot of things here.

4. The actual 3-point IK is just done through the aim solver provided by the DragonIK plugin.
In case your character uses the epic skeleton, you can use pretty much the same settings. If not,
just renaming the bone names in the aim solver is enough.

5. Apart from the fullbodyIK folder, the main blueprint side modifications are done in the 
BP_VR_Character (or the Vive_PawnCharacter in 4.27). The core events are present inside the
"DragonIK related modifications" comment section. The relevant variabls and functions are put
inside the DragonIK category.

6. A minor modification is done in the GraspingHand blueprint (just adding the DragonIK_Hand_AnchorPoint
empty component).

7. The Yin_Skeleton_Animblueprint does the bulk of the dragonIK related work. You can even just
copy this animbp directly into your project and change the skeleton to your own skeleton. Especially
best if your character uses the epic skeleton.
